        <p>During this reflection essay we are supposed to sum up and reflect about the project itself, and reflect on what it has helped us with, and what we have learned from the project. Therefore, each member from the group have written a paragraph to reflect their experience with the project.</p>
        <div class="container">
          <ul>
              <li><p><b>Kai</b>: During the project we were asked to choose a sub brand from the company Tempo and choose a country where they will consider globalizing. We chose a Jewelry brand called Jaharia do Carmo and chose to research the market in the USA. During the project I personally researched about the social cultural factor within PESTEL analysis about the US jewelry market, and found out the different trends Americans have toward jewelry. I learned the importance of following trends in different countries, understanding what the customers like and prefer in the end, producing a product that fits that society. I also researched some manufacturers and the regulations of importing and exporting in and out of the USA. I took this question as a real life experience, as if I were to do the same in future these will be some of the things I need to consider. In the end the whole project showed me the complexity and steps of when one brand is trying to go abroad and globalize. I enjoyed the project and this will surely help me in my future.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Alan</b>: Working with Valor do Tempo for this project, a company whose each brand line is full of Portuguese culture and personality made me be more careful and try to understand the brand to pick a strategy that would preserve the essence that the brand has. Working with Joalheria do Carmo was an opportunity to learn more about the Jewelry industry when doing the PESTEL, learned a lot more about the new technologies being used in this industry, also it was an interesting lesson about the USA market that on one hand has a lot of acceptance for new products trying to penetrate de market but on another hand, it is super competitive. I enjoyed doing this project to practice more of my marketing skills on a project that is similar to what will be when working in a company in the future.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Elysia</b>: During the project, I researched what kind of entry modes and retail strategies should be adopted to successfully launch Joalheriria do Carmo in the US jewelry market and overseas. I learned the different product market strategies that can help a firm in a host country carry out its marketing operations successfully. This analysis can be used in reference to the real world when a firm plans on expanding their business internationally and showed me all the different approaches it can take. I enjoyed learning about the barriers of entry a firm may face when expanding their markets abroad. It was interesting to see all the different factors that can prevent a firm into a market. I overall enjoyed this project and working with students abroad. The use of the pestel and market analysis gave me more insight of all the steps a business should take when expanding internationally and I hope to use the skills I learned in my future workplace.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>D’angelo</b>: During the project, I the competitive intensity, including the main competitors and the nature of the competition. While researching, I found that the U.S jewelry market is very competitive. Still, it is also growing at a tremendous rate, and a company like Joalheriria do Carmo should do well. I learned how to look for the competitive intensity within different companies in the same market and distinguish what separates Joalheriria do Carmo from other companies. This analysis can be used for firms that are planning to venture off into the international business world to view what they will be up against with their competitors. This project showed me how much research is needed in order for a company to see if taking the initiative to open locations abroad would be beneficial or not. I enjoyed participating in this project, and I also enjoyed learning about the different techniques that are used to find the competitive intensity of a market.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Jakub</b>: While working in a group on our project, I learned many things. I had no idea the jewelry industry was turning into an "ethical" industry and how many factors affect it from the outside environment. Together, we learned a lot about the jewelry market, how it works, how competition interacts, etc .Getting to know new market entry strategies and trying to adapt to the company we choose is definitely a practical use of knowledge.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Tiago</b>: During this project I’ve learned and gained knowledge in an area I think will be crucial in our future. To understand the economic, political, social, ethical and legal values of a country is the main part when exporting a business, succeeding by the importance of understanding the product as well. During this project I learned more about jewelry specially, and a little bit about every Valor do Tempo brand, with the objective of finding the best brand of the group for us to work with.</p></li>
              <li><p><b>Cody</b>: During this project, it challenged me to learn new aspects on how to evaluate a company through a PESTEL and market analysis. My team decided to go with the Joalheria de Carmo jewelry store and it opened my eyes to how differently you must approach your market entry and delivery depending on the country and demographic you plan to work with. The country that we were assigned was the United States and the jewelry market is very competitive here and still continuing to grow. We had to determine how we could set ourselves apart from the rest whether it be our marketing approach, our entry mode, or our general knowledge on the market potential and target market.</p></li>
