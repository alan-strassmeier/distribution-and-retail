      <h1>Joalharia do Carmo
      </h1>
      <p>Joalharia do Carmo Founded in 1924, Joalharia do Carmo supplied Lisbon’s elite with exclusive pieces of silver and precious stone jewelry in a unique space. JOALHARIA DO CARMO has been listed as a “Shop with History” by Lisbon City Council and preserves its original identity, remaining a faithful guardian of the art of timeless jewelry. The distinctive branding of the façade, the Portuguese shield over the Cross of Christ inserted in a highly ornate crowned heart, inspired the concept for the space. There, filigree shines in a carefully-crafted sequence of fine gold thread that superbly outlines works of art of the finest Portuguese jewelry. Featuring floral or marine motifs, representations of religion, or inspired by love with iconic Viana hearts echoing the heart that stands out on the façade, Joalharia do Carmo is a showcase for unique pieces that serve as ambassadors of Portugal throughout the world.</p>

            <p>During this project, we were asked to choose one sub brand of Tempo and analyze the company and its market. Then we need to choose a country and analyze if it is possible for the sub brand to globalize. Our group decided to choose Joalharia do Carmo for the sub brand, and USA for the country. 
            </p>
            <p >
              Joalharia do Carmo, is a jewelry store for the middle-upper class and will trade more than $50,000 in precious metals, precious stones, jewels, or finished goods. The demand that the market has over companies to be eco-friendly, that also includes the jewelry sector, also the jewelry products must be required from ethical sources, the consumer will not tolerate things such as "blood diamonds". Joalharia do Carmo is a shop of history, they mainly sell gold jewelries including rings, necklaces, and earrings. The shop was acquired by Tempo back in the 1920s. The store has omnichannel including physical store, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest

              USA being one of the biggest jewelry markets in the world before any research is able to give Joalharia do Carmo a lot of potential. The U.S. jewelry market was valued at about 76 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Diamond jewelry is the most valuable jewelry market in the United States. This market was forecast to reach a value of over 21 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. There is a significant number of Portuguese Americans by ancestry and Portuguese by country of birth community in the USA, almost 1.5 million, and it is a country with 21% of the population being catholic both of these demographics are more prone to be interested in Joalheria do Carmo products. Carmo Jewelry should maybe implement some techniques that many producers are using in the USA such as the use of 3D printing. Even in the 2008 crisis that many luxury goods weren't seen as a priority, the jewelry sector wasn't as affected as other sectors.
</p>
<p>Throughout the PESTEL analysis we researched and covered points along the lines of what impact will a Portuguese jewelry store like Joalharia do Carmo have on the US market? What impact does the crisis have on jewelry on the US market? How would Joalharia do Carmo be received by Portuguese Americans? In what segments could Joalharia do Carmo prospect in the US market? These will be the research question we follow throughout the research
