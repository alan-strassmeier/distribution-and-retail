          The request for gold worldwide fell to below 3,800 metric tons in 2020, the lowest in the last 10 years. There are several different industries that use gold, and in recent years, the largest of these has been the jewelry industry. In 2020, however, it was replaced in the first place by investment demand, since it is one of the safest investments due to the liquidity it offers.

      <div id="entry-mode" class="col-lg-12 pt-8 pr-lg-0">
        <h3>Based on the above, what Entry Mode should be used? What retail strategy should be adopted? Distribution channels? Justify why and how it can be made? What barriers to entry in your market exist?</h3>
        
        <p>Franchising gives the firm the right to use an entire business system in exchange for fees, royalties, or other compensation. Joalheiria do Carmo has the potential to be franchised in the U.S. and other foreign countries. The brand as the franchisor will be trademark-protected and will provide patents, training, products, and proper instructions on how to run their stores. The franchisee compensates the franchisor through a combination of lump-sum payments, down-payment plus royalty, and other mark-ups. Placing franchises overseas in a country like the U.S. will generate income with a low investment and effort once established. Franchising can quickly internationalize to many markets abroad as well. The firm should adopt a high-end retail strategy. Joalheiria do Carmo can establish a retail store in a high end shopping/business location. The store will be decorated in luxury interior design to promote a high end shopping experience for the customer. Elaborate services can include gift wrapping, layaway, delivery, and alterations. Jewelry can be distributed directly to retail stores or the online shop from wholesalers or imported overseas from manufacturers. Common barriers to entry can include startup costs,finding suppliers, licenses and certifications, distribution challenges, competition, and brand equity.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/unnamed (1).png" alt="">
        <p>After the research, here are some of the recommendations we have for the strategy of a successful market entrance.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to ensure a successful market entry and sustained performance in the jewelry industry. One of the most important being to set our business goals early on. In recent trends, it appears that jewelry customers around the world are willing and prefer to pay more if they are guaranteed that the jewelry was made ethically and its production did not contribute to any degradation of the environment. It is important that upon purchase, we provide the customer with all of the jewelry quality certificates, so they have information on the manufacturer and all of the steps taken in producing that specific piece of jewelry. Joalheiria do Carmo must must also do thorough research and understand its target market. In 2020, the jewelry market was valued at approximately $76 billion so it is undeniably a very large industry. We understand that jewelry trends come and go so we must add other values to the customer. Many people wear jewelry to serve a religious purpose, so we should consider offering a wide variety of religious pieces in our inventory. Jewelry trends vary depending on the age of the customer as well. It is shown that young people usually prefer white jewelry, as yellow gold is more popular among the older generation. Although we hope to market towards the upper-middle class, it is crucial that Joalheiria do Carmo offers affordable options such as swarovski crystals or cubic zirconia options for those unable or unwilling to pay for the extra cost for natural diamonds.</p>
