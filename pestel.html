          <h3>Political factor</h3>
          
          <p>The United States government has different laws and regulations for gemstones, metals, and children's jewelry. Also has regulations for money laundering. Under the US Patriot Act, a branch of the Department of the Treasury requires vendors in precious metals, stones, or jewels to verify an Anti-Money Laundering compliance program. Vendors are defined as any person or company who yearly buys and sells more than $50,000 in precious metals, precious stones, jewels, or finished goods deriving more than 50% of their value from precious metals, stones, or jewels. For children's jewelry, retailers should notify their suppliers of children’s plated metal jewelry and other children’s items that they must furnish proof of the lead-content testing and certificate demanded of manufacturers and direct importers of children’s jewelry. More recently due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where Russian forces launched a full invasion on Thursday, February 24 that has led to multiple civilian casualties and serious breaches of international law. In reaction, the United States and Western governments have come out vehemently in sentencing and sanctioning Russia. Manny's political organization believes the crisis will persist in escalating in the coming days. While the U.S. has not directly sanctioned diamonds, precious metals, or precious gemstones from Russia or Belarus, the current sanctions and continuing Anti-Money Laundering requirements effectively prevent U.S. companies from legally sourcing materials from those countries.

        <div  id="environmental" class="col-lg-12 pt-8 pr-lg-0">
          <h3>Environmental factor</h3>
          
          <p>The 2030 Agenda assumes the implementation of 17 Sustainable Development goals and 169 related tasks that reflect the three dimensions of sustainable development - economic, social, and environmental. The assumption is that activities aimed at achieving goals require activity and achieving progress simultaneously on these three levels and in an integrated manner. It should be noted that the jewelry industry will have to conform to new rules that aim at responsible consumption and production and place the jewelry industry responsible for introducing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In order to function in the new reality, the jewelry industry must become a "green" industry and strive to introduce to the market not only jewelry products obtained from "ethical sources", but also those that will serve the user for years. Customers who decide to buy jewelry begin to pay attention to completely different features of it than a few years ago, its aesthetic aspect and the value it presents, both emotional and material, are not important. The method of its production begins to count. Growing consumer awareness and concern for the natural environment means that customers are primarily guided in their purchases by ecological values. The "ecological certificate" becomes the most important aspect of jewelry offered by manufacturers, therefore, when introducing an assortment to your stores, you should keep this in mind. World trends show that the fashion for jewelry has come to an end. Jewelry worn only a few times no longer meets customer expectations. Growing ecological awareness means that consumers all over the world when deciding to buy jewelry, choose the one that will accompany them for years. . Buying ornaments that go out of style after one season has become unsustainable. customers around the world prefer to pay more, but be sure that the jewelry they wear is ethical jewelry and its production did not contribute to the degradation of the natural environment. At the same time, they (customers) want the producers to present, along with the jewelry quality certificate, information on the manufacture of the purchased jewelry item. Customers are interested in every stage of creating jewelry because only transparency allows them to be sure that the jewelry they buy is ethical. At the same time, it should be noted that more and more jewelry companies present on their websites every stage of work on jewelry, thus building customer confidence in their brand. A very important issue for potential customers is also the issue of employees working in the extraction of precious stones and metals.</p>

          <h3>Social - cultural factor</h3>
          
          <p>Jewelry often represents a person's status, both in today's society and throughout history. 
            People of higher social status or wealth often own and wear more valuable jewelry. Jewelry could be worn for 2 reasons. Religion, many pieces of jewelry serve a religious purpose. In America there are Protestant (42%), Catholic (21%), Mormon (2%), Unaffiliated (18%), Atheist (5%), Agnostic (6%), Jewish (1%), Muslim (1%). Or wealth or social status as a way of reflecting a person’s wealth. The most often used materials of pieces of jewelry in the USA are gold, metal, silver, copper, stainless steel, brass, aluminum, plastic, and steel.Young people generally prefer white color jewelry, white stones and metals, including silver, white gold, and platinum, were chosen by students and young professionals. If so far they cannot afford natural diamonds, their choice is cubic zirconia or Swarovski crystals. White color jewelry represents a more modern and progressive image, rather than yellow gold, which is more popular among the older generations. The U.S. jewelry market was valued at about 76 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Diamond jewelry is the most valuable jewelry market in the United States. This market was forecast to reach a value of over 21 billion U.S. dollars by 2025.
            </p>

        <div id="technology-factor" class="col-lg-12 pt-8 pr-lg-0">
          <h3>Technology factor</h3>
          
          <p>The jewelry store relies on its Information Technology system to maintain connectivity in all its operations and retail outlets. However, there is always the threat of IT systems breaking down, leading to the loss of vital data. Innovation in terms of design and manufacturing technology is one of the primary factors that will trigger the growth of the global gems and jewelry market in the upcoming years. The market for personalized jewelry is rising among buyers, especially in the USA, it allows them to select their wished designs and further customize their jewelry by adding gemstones and other precious stones. Manufacturers are using advanced technology such as laser sintering and induction technology to fulfill these requirements. Computer-aided design (CAD) is an important tool that helps manufacturers create and prototype new designs faster. In the past, manufacturers utilized rubber molds to create copies of the original master model. Yet, if variations on that model were required, the model designer would have to make a whole new model. With CAD software, the designer can easily change the model with the clicks of a mouse, and the new model can be printed on-demand on a CAM machine, such as a 3D printer. 3D printers enable manufacturers to print resin prototypes of the CAD model that is easily cast. Also, some jewelry stores are even using 3D printers that can print the CAD design directly into gold making many perfect copies needed.

They specialized in decorative silver and unique jewelry exclusive pieces. Filigrana Portuguesa, which plays a big role in Portuguese history, is used in the majority of the pieces at Joalharia do Carmo.

Between 1986 and 2022: Jewelry experienced an average inflation rate of 1.79% per year. In short, jewelry costing $100 in the year 1986 would cost $189.37 in 2022 for an equivalent purchase. Compared to the overall inflation rate of 2.65% during this same period, inflation for jewelry was lower.</p>
          <p>Jewelry, gold, silver among other precious metals and stones are always safe investments and an important asset in the economy. Many investors prefer investing in this because it is less risky than other markets. Gold and silver were always major financial and economic assets for banks and countries. It is used by them as an indicator of economic health. During the 2008 economic crisis, many luxury goods weren’t seen as a priority and people started buying more mundane and cheaper goods and services. However, luxury goods customers changed their shopping behavior and started buying more strategically, jewelry wasn’t affected as most of the products. Luxury brands needed to focus their marketing strategy and messages on quality and value rather than on image or status, so affluent shoppers wouldn’t decide on other brands. During this time, the quality, the value, the image, and the status are all undoubtedly factors in jewelry, so this type of consumer tended to lean towards jewelry when looking for luxury goods even during this crisis.
